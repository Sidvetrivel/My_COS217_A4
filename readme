Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

It was a very helpful assignment to helping learn gdb as well as 
well as understanding how testing works. While frustrating at times, on
the whole it was fun for sure.

(Use -exportlocal to inhibit warning)
  checkerDT.c:91:1: Definition of CheckerDT_Node_isValid

Finished checking --- 34 code warnings

Warnings relating to functions delcared but not defined:

We disagree with these warnings as the design is much more modular 
if we were to split our design between the source file and the header
file to protect the definition of the functions from the client. 
In the implementation we are using, it is not neccessary to 
define the function within path.h, nodeDT.h, and dynarray.h.


Warning relating to CheckerDT_Node_isValid not being used outside of 
checkerDT:

We disagree with this warning as even though we do not call this 
function by itself, it is crucial to the CheckerDT_isValid function 
that is called. However, we want to give client the option to call
if any particular Node is valid even though the sample client for 
2DT does not actually call this function.

disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

checkerDT.c: line 51: low priority: 
A loop should consist of fewer than 35 lines;
this loop consists of 36 lines; consider refactoring

Line 51: We disagree with this comment because while it is 
very much feasible to get the loop down to <35 lines, we are
choosing to keep the line breaks to ensure better readibility
of code.

Line 93:
checkerDT.c: line 102: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'realIndex' through an assert?

Line 93: We think that there isn't a need to validate
realIndex as it is initialized to 0 when CheckerDT_isValid 
is called.

For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1       BDT_insert
