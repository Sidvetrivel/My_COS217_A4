Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

It was a very helpful assignment to helping learn gdb as well as 
well as understanding how testing works. While frustrating at times, on
the whole it was fun for sure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

I found the assignment challenging but also very rewarding in the end
when we were able to complete it. Understanding conceptually what to
do was often the most challenging part of the assignment rather than
just the coding itself.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

We don't have any bugs in the functionality of the program but this is
more to do with splint and critTer warnings. We weren't sure
if we were supposed to address function declaration/definition warnings.
Instead of doing it for every instance, we highlighted that we did
have many of these warnings throughout all the splint checks we did
accross both DT and FT and that we generally disagree which can be
applied to all other instances of the same error. Hopefully, this is 
thorough enough.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

(list does not include many function declaration/definition warnings)
checkerDT.h:21:9: Function exported but not used outside checkerDT:
                     CheckerDT_Node_isValid
A declaration is exported, but not used outside this module. 
Declaration can use static qualifier. 
(Use -exportlocal to inhibit warning)
  checkerDT.c:91:1: Definition of CheckerDT_Node_isValid


Warnings relating to functions being declared but not defined:
(applicable to all later instances of this same warning which
there are multiple of)

We disagree with these warnings as the design maintains modularity
when splitting our design between the source file and the header
file to protect the definition of the functions from the client. 
In the implementation we are using, it is not neccessary to 
define the function within path.h, nodeDT.h, and dynarray.h. We want 
our interfaced to hide the implementation details and keep the client
from accessing or manipulating the data directly.


Warning relating to CheckerDT_Node_isValid not being used outside of 
checkerDT:

We disagree with this warning as even though we do not call this 
function by itself, it is crucial to the CheckerDT_isValid function 
that is called. However, we want to give client the option to call
if any particular Node is valid even though the sample client for 
2DT does not actually call this function.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

Line 93:
checkerDT.c: line 102: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'realIndex' through an assert?

Line 93: We think that there isn't a need to validate
realIndex as it is initialized to 0 when CheckerDT_isValid 
is called.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

-----------THE FOLLOWING WARNINGS PERTAIN TO FILE ft.c------------------

(list does not include many function declaration/definition warnings)
ft.c: (in function FT_traversePath)
ft.c:91:42: Variable ulChildID used before definition
  An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some 
  execution path. (Use -usedef to inhibit warning)
ft.c: (in function FT_replaceFileContents)
ft.c:421:4: Return value (type void *) ignored: Node_replaceCont...
  Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, 
  can cast result to (void) to eliminate message. 
  (Use -retvalother to inhibit warning)

Warning regarding usage of ulChild before instantiation:

While it is best practice to instantiate ulChild to NULL, it is not
neccessary in this context as regardless of where the pointer for
ulChild is pointing to, its address is sure to change with the function
Node_hasChild is called.

Warning regarding the result of Node_replaceContents not being used:

Since the function FT_replaceFileContents does not return the result
of Node_replaceContents, there is no need to capture the result. We 
only need the function to replace the contents of the file and do not
need the result (the old contents) to be returned within 
FT_replaceFileContents.

Warnings relating to functions being declared but not defined:

We disagree with these warnings as these warnings flag the use of a 
header file and separate source code files. However, by doing this,
it makes the code much more modular and easier to read. Furthermore,
the header file serves the purpose of protecting the implementations
of the functions from the client. As a result, we can ignore this 
warning for path.h, nodeDT.h, and dynarray.h.

-------THE FOLLOWING WARNINGS PERTAIN TO FILE NodeFT.c------------------

(list does not include many function declaration/definition warnings)
nodeFT.c: (in function Node_new)
nodeFT.c:176:48: Variable ulIndex used before definition
  An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some 
  execution path. (Use -usedef to inhibit warning)
nodeFT.c: (in function Node_free)
nodeFT.c:203:35: Variable ulIndex used before definition


Warning relating to the use of ulIndex before definition:
While the size_t ulIndex is not formally initialized, we agree
with splint on that it would be a good practice to ensure
variables are initialized before they are used. This will mitigate
both warnings pertaining to the usage of ulIndex before definition.

your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

---------------------WARNINGS ON FILE ft.c------------------------------

(list does not include file length warnings, 
number of function warnings, or loop length warnings)

Warnings regarding comment specifications:
We agree with critTer's warnings regarding specificity on what the 
comments of certain functions should state such as what it returns
and making sure all its parameters are referenced within the function
comment. We will accept these suggestions.

Warnings regarding asserts:
We disagree with criTer on these warning messages as we find asserting
these values to be unneccessary as variables like pcPath won't be NULL.


---------------------WARNINGS ON FILE nodeFT.c--------------------------

nodeFT.h: line 97: high priority: 
A function's comment should refer to each parameter by name;
your comment does not refer to 'oNNode'

nodeFT.h: line 97: high priority:

nodeFT.c: line 80: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'pvContents' through an assert?

nodeFT.c: line 307: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'pvNewContents' through an assert?

Warnings regarding comment specificity:
We agree with all of critTer's comment warnings as it is good practice
to refer to all parameters of a function and what it returns within
the function's comments.

Warnings regarding asserts:
We disagree as it is not neccessary to assert all these variables since
they can be any value (including NULL) when they are passed as a 
parameter to certain functions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1       BDT_insert
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2       BDT_FreeSubtree
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3       BDT_addChild
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4       BDT_strlenAccumulate
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5       BDT_freeNode
===============================================================

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?

Here is a bullet point list of critiques for the DT implementations:

DT_insert and DT_rm naming: 
The naming betwee these functions could be more consistent when it 
comes to whether we use words as opposed to abbrieviations. If
we were to have abbrieviations in both the function declarations, we 
would make sure in the header file that they contracts are descriptive.
However, it would be better to make dt_rm to remove to maintain this 
naming consistency.

DT_init vs DT_destroy naming:
The naming between these functions could be more consist where instead
of init, it may be a better naming convention to use create to show
that these functions achieve the opposite.

Node_new declaration parameter ordering:
Parameter order should be consistent between all the nodeDT.h functions.
In this case, the Node_T parameters should come first before the Path_T
object. This would make it more consistent with the function 
declarations since they all have Node_T parameters first.
 
While loop within DT_insert:
This while loop could possible refactored as it is quite large and spans
close to 30 lines. Normally, this would be fine but since the DT_insert
function is already quite large, refactoring this while loop could 
improve readbility as a whole for the function.

DT_preOrderTraversal Assertion:
The static method in dtGood.c takes in three parameters but it does not
assert all 3 and doesn't assert the size_t value (i). In the event that
i is null, this assert would be helpful in identifying any such error
that this may cause.

DT_preOrderTraversal pulChild Naming:
the variable name pulChildID is a little misleading as the variable 
doesn't actually denote the ID of the particular node but instead the
index of that particular node. So, a name like pulChildIndex may be 
more appropriate.
