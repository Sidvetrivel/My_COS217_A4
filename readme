Student 1: What unauthorized sources of information did you use to
complete the assignment? List any unauthorized sources of information
that you used to complete the assignment, and describe how you used
them. The course "Policies" web page defines unauthorized sources of
information, and any source that you have used but not listed in the
authorized sources should be included here. Please note that using an
unauthorized source may trigger a course penalty, and depending on the
nature of the interaction, may additionally require the interaction
being reported to the Committee on Discipline. Write "None" if you used
no unauthorized sources of information.

None

Student 1: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

It was a very helpful assignment to helping learn gdb as well as 
well as understanding how testing works. While frustrating at times, on
the whole it was fun for sure.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Student 2: What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful?
Was it fun?

I found the assignment challenging but also very rewarding in the end
when we were able to complete it. Understanding conceptually what to
do was often the most challenging part of the assignment rather than
just the coding itself.

(optional) What information can you provide about your submission that
will help your grader to grade it in the most favorable light? In
particular, what bugs are in your submission?

N/A

------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate for Part 2's checker, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

(list does not include many function declaration/definition warnings)
checkerDT.h:21:9: Function exported but not used outside checkerDT:
                     CheckerDT_Node_isValid
A declaration is exported, but not used outside this module. 
Declaration can use static qualifier. 
(Use -exportlocal to inhibit warning)
  checkerDT.c:91:1: Definition of CheckerDT_Node_isValid


Warnings relating to functions being declared but not defined:
(applicable to all later instances of this same warning)

We disagree with these warnings as the design is much more modular 
if we were to split our design between the source file and the header
file to protect the definition of the functions from the client. 
In the implementation we are using, it is not neccessary to 
define the function within path.h, nodeDT.h, and dynarray.h.


Warning relating to CheckerDT_Node_isValid not being used outside of 
checkerDT:

We disagree with this warning as even though we do not call this 
function by itself, it is crucial to the CheckerDT_isValid function 
that is called. However, we want to give client the option to call
if any particular Node is valid even though the sample client for 
2DT does not actually call this function.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does critTer generate on checkerDT.c, and what are your
disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and express
your disagreement after each warning. If there are no warnings, then
write "None."

Line 93:
checkerDT.c: line 102: medium priority:
Do you want to validate 'realIndex' through an assert?

Line 93: We think that there isn't a need to validate
realIndex as it is initialized to 0 when CheckerDT_isValid 
is called.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
What warnings does splint generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the splint warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."

-----------THE FOLLOWING WARNINGS PERTAIN TO FILE ft.c------------------

(list does not include many function declaration/definition warnings)
ft.c: (in function FT_traversePath)
ft.c:91:42: Variable ulChildID used before definition
  An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some execution
  path. (Use -usedef to inhibit warning)
ft.c: (in function FT_replaceFileContents)
ft.c:421:4: Return value (type void *) ignored: Node_replaceCont...
  Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, can cast
  result to (void) to eliminate message. (Use -retvalother to inhibit warning)

Warning regarding usage of ulChild before instantiation:

While it is best practice to instantiate ulChild to NULL, it is not
neccessary in this context as regardless of where the pointer for
ulChild is pointing to, its address is sure to change with the function
Node_hasChild is called.

Warning regarding the result of Node_replaceContents not being used:

Since the function FT_replaceFileContents does not return the result
of Node_replaceContents, there is no need to capture the result. We 
only need the function to replace the contents of the file and do not
need the result (the old contents) to be returned within 
FT_replaceFileContents.

Warnings relating to functions being declared but not defined:

We disagree with these warnings as these warnings flag the use of a 
header file and separate source code files. However, by doing this,
it makes the code much more modular and easier to read. Furthermore,
the header file serves the purpose of protecting the implementations
of the functions from the client. As a result, we can ignore this 
warning for path.h, nodeDT.h, and dynarray.h.

-------THE FOLLOWING WARNINGS PERTAIN TO FILE NodeFT.c------------------

(list does not include many function declaration/definition warnings)
nodeFT.c: (in function Node_new)
nodeFT.c:176:48: Variable ulIndex used before definition
  An rvalue is used that may not be initialized to a value on some 
  execution path. (Use -usedef to inhibit warning)
nodeFT.c: (in function Node_free)
nodeFT.c:203:35: Variable ulIndex used before definition


Warning relating to the use of ulIndex before definition:

While the size_t ulIndex is not formally initialized, we agree
with splint on that it would be a good practice to ensure
variables are initialized before they are used. This will mitigate
both warnings pertaining to the usage of ulIndex before definition.

What warnings does critTer generate on your Part 3 code, and what are
your disagreements with them? Copy the critTer warnings here, and
express your disagreement after each warning. If there are no
warnings, then write "None."



------------------------------------------------------------------------
For each of the five faulty BDT implementations required by Step
1.5, identify the function where there is a bug. You do not have to
identify the bug itself, only its location, but note that this must be
the location of the underlying error, which is not necessarily where
the error manifests itself or is "noticed" by the client.


      Executable         Function with the underlying error
===============================================================
         ./bdtBad1       BDT_insert
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad2       BDT_FreeSubtree
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad3       BDT_addChild
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad4       BDT_strlenAccumulate
---------------------------------------------------------------
         ./bdtBad5       BDT_freeNode
===============================================================

What are your critiques of the given DT implementations, as
specified in Step 2.5?
